Deployment

Two main components are required to use Determined: the :ref:`Determined CLI <install-cli>` and a
Determined cluster. All users should install the Determined CLI on their
local development machine. The Determined cluster should be installed in your training environment,
which might be your local development machine, an on-premise GPU cluster, or resources in the cloud.

For a single user with a local machine, the easiest way is likely using the Determined Deploy package to install
the Determined CLI and start a cluster on a local machine:

****************************
 Install Determined Locally
****************************

Use the following code to install Determined and start a cluster locally.

.. code:: bash

   # Install the Determined library
   pip install determined

   # Start a cluster.
   det deploy local cluster-up

   # Use CLI to check resources on cluster
   det slot

For more advanced deployments to an on-premise hardware cluster, cloud environment, or Kubernetes, refer to the
