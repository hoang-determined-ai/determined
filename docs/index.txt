***********************
 What is Determined AI?
***********************

Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and
easy.

*******************
 Why Determined AI?
*******************

Determined enables you to:

-  **Train models faster** using state-of-the-art :ref:`distributed training <multi-gpu-training>`,
   without changing your model code
-  **Automatically find high-quality models** with advanced :ref:`hyperparameter tuning
   <hyperparameter-tuning>` from the creators of Hyperband
-  **Get more from your GPUs** with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU costs by seamlessly using
   preemptible instances
-  **Track and reproduce your work** with experiment tracking that works out-of-the-box, covering
   code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning environment
--- which means you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure. You can
continue using popular Deep Learning libraries, such as :doc:`TensorFlow Keras
</training-apis/api-keras>`, :doc:`TensorFlow Estimator </training-apis/api-estimator>` and
:doc:`PyTorch </training-apis/api-pytorch>`; you just need to update your model code to integrate
with the Determined API.
