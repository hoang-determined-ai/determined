 Overview
**********

Determined leverages specific APIs for each ML Framework. In general, users convert their existing model code by
subclassing a Trial class and implementing methods that advertise components of the user's model - e.g. model
architecture, data loader, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, callbacks, etc. This is called the Trial definition
and by structuring their code in this way, Determined is able to run the training loop and provide advanced training
and model management capabilities.

Once users' model code are ported to Determined's APIs, they can use an :doc:`experiment configuration
</configurations/experiment-config>` to configure how Determined should train the model - e.g. multi-GPU,
hyperparameter search, etc.

If you have existing model code that you'd like to run on Determined, continue to one of the API docs below
depending on your ML Framework.

.. note::
   If you'd like a review of implementing the Determined APIs on example models, please take a look at our
   :doc:`Tutorials </tutorials/index>`. Or, if you'd like to build off of an existing model that already runs on
   Determined, take a look at our :doc:`examples </examples>` to see if the model you'd like to run is already
   available.
