Tutorials are simple step-by-step guides to showcase how standard models are run in Determined. For running your
own custom model, we recommend reviewing tutorials and examples to get an idea of what is possible, then following
the **PRE-TRAINING**, **TRAINING**, and **POST-TRAINING** sections for details on each component of training models in
Determined.

.. tab:: PyTorch

    For PyTorch users, you can start with :doc:`the tutorial that uses the simplest model MNIST
    </tutorials/tf-mnist-tutorial>`. For a more detailed tutorial with a real-world model, you can
    follow :doc:`/tutorials/pytorch-porting-tutorial` to port your code to use our Pytorch APIs.

.. tab:: TensorFlow Keras
